# FAFD
A Fast as F*** Downloader
#Github Usages
You'll want to use a URL like this:
"""https://github.com/RPowell-C/FAFD/raw/main/FAFD.py"""
It's easier
#DONT FORGET THE /raw/ PART
#Normal Usages 
Find the url to the file you want to download, this tool will pull webpages so be careful until I implement that
